      <h2>Yael Rosen </h2> 
      <p>For my project I decided to use personal data and thought my step count would be interesting. I compiled every step count for the day in a spreadsheet and found out which day from each month I had the highest step count in. From them, I used images from my camera roll to represent that day. I determined this layout, and these buttons would be nice for the user to interact with. </p>
